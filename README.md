## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox (included in bootstrap components)
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I have been practising Bootstrap 5. However, sometimes, it is better to use pure css even though I can customize the value in Bootstrap 5. Bootstrap 5 is just an amazing css framework.  

### Continued development

In the next projects, I will try to customize the Bootstrap css files instead of using the pure css on my own. As I still feel that my responsive skill is not satisfied for me. I will learn to make the best responsive layout for every devices.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://getbootstrap.com/) - This is the only framework that I use in this project. This helps me a lot to create layout.
